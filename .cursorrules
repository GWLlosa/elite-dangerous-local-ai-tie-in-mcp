name: Elite Dangerous MCP â€“ Cursor Rules
description: Concise rules for Cursor to follow in this repo.

rules:
  - Use feature branches and open PRs; do not merge without explicit approval.
  - Run `python scripts/check_dependencies.py` before substantial changes.
  - Run tests with `python scripts/run_tests.py`; maintain >90% coverage for new code.
  - Produce ASCII-only program output and Python strings (no emojis/smart quotes/Unicode symbols).
  - Issue bugfix workflow: When asked to investigate/fix an issue: (1) Read issue via `gh issue view`, (2) Validate with reproduction tests, (3) Create branch `bugfix/<number>-<description>`, (4) Write failing tests with issue links, (5) Fix code, (6) Update docs, (7) Create PR with `Fixes #<number>`, (8) Provide PR link. See `ai-directives/issue_investigation_workflow.md`.
  - Create timezone-aware UTC datetimes: `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`.
  - Empty string defaults: treat "" as selecting defaults for optional inputs; only `None` is an error for required fields.
  - ProcessedEvent: use `raw_event` for original dict; use `key_data` for derived fields.
  - JournalParser: `read_journal_file()` returns `(entries, position)`; always unpack both.
  - JournalMonitor: provide required constructor params, including `journal_path` and `event_callback`.
  - DataStore: use `query_events(...)`, `get_recent_events(minutes)`, `get_events_by_type(...)`, `get_events_by_category(...)`; never `get_all_events()`.
  - Convert hours to minutes when calling `get_recent_events`.
  - MCP resources: return structured error objects for unknown URIs; never return `None`.
  - FastMCP: use `@app.tool()`; do not depend on `app.tools`.
  - Template variables: support formatted placeholders like `{credits:,}` and `{distance:.1f}` when validating.
  - EDCoPilot chatter must follow `docs/edcopilot-chatter-grammar.md`; replace all tokens with safe fallbacks.
  - Update docs when behavior changes.
  - Documentation update protocol: when asked to "update docs" or "add a rule", update all three:
    - `AGENTS.md` (binding rules)
    - `.cursorrules` (this file; keep in sync with AGENTS.md wording)
    - `ai-directives/` (project context: goals, strategies, status, reports)
    - Place rules in AGENTS.md/.cursorrules, and project context in ai-directives.

prohibited:
  - Introducing non-ASCII characters in code or logs.
  - Using `event.data` or `get_all_events()`.
  - Returning `None` for expected error objects.
  - Creating naive datetimes or assuming local time.
  - Depending on undocumented framework attributes.

testing:
  - Prefer `scripts/run_tests.py` for full runs.
  - Mock external dependencies; keep tests deterministic and cross-platform.

notes:
  - This file complements AGENTS.md at the repo root. If rules conflict, follow AGENTS.md and direct human instructions.
