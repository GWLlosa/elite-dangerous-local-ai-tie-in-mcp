Test for Issue #13: EDCoPilot Chatter Generation Not Respecting Theme Context

GitHub Issue: https://github.com/GWLlosa/elite-dangerous-local-ai-tie-in-mcp/issues/13

Problem: The EDCoPilot chatter generator does not use theme/context from ThemeStorage
         when generating chatter files. Generated content is always generic, regardless
         of the theme set via set_edcopilot_theme.

Expected: Generated chatter should reflect the theme and context (e.g., crew names,
          specific references from context, thematic language).

Actual (before fix): All generated chatter is generic with placeholders like
                     "Commander" and "Unknown System".
