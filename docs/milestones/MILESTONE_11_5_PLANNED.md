#  Milestone 11.5: Dynamic Multi-Crew Theme System

**Status**:  **PLANNED** - Ready for Implementation
**Priority**: High User Value Enhancement
**Estimated Complexity**: Low-Medium
**Dependencies**: Milestone 11 (EDCoPilot Integration) [OK] Complete

##  Milestone Overview

**Objective**: Transform EDCoPilot integration from static templates to dynamic, AI-generated theme-based dialogue with ship-specific multi-crew personalities.

**Core Innovation**: Enable users to set narrative themes (e.g., "space pirate", "corporate executive", "military veteran") and have all EDCoPilot chatter dynamically generated to match that theme while preserving game data integration and supporting realistic crew compositions based on ship size.

##  Key Features

###  **1. Dynamic Theme Generation**
Transform EDCoPilot dialogue personality with user-defined themes while maintaining token functionality.

**Examples:**
```
Default: "Entering {SystemName}, Commander. Scanning for points of interest."
Pirate Theme: "Entering {SystemName}. Raise the Jolly Roger, matey! Scanning for merchant vessels."
Corporate Theme: "Entering {SystemName}. Analyzing market opportunities and profit potential."
```

###  **2. Ship-Specific Multi-Crew System**
Realistic crew compositions based on ship size with individual personalities per crew member.

**Ship Categories:**
- **Small Ships (1-2 crew)**: Sidewinder (solo), Cobra MkIII (commander + engineer)
- **Medium Ships (3-4 crew)**: Asp Explorer (commander, navigator, science, engineer)
- **Large Ships (5+ crew)**: Anaconda (commander, navigator, science, engineer, security, comms)

**Crew Roles:**
- **Commander**: Player character voice
- **Navigator**: Jump calculations, route planning
- **Science Officer**: Scanning, exploration, discoveries
- **Engineer**: Ship systems, fuel, repairs
- **Security Chief**: Combat, threats, defense
- **Comms Officer**: Station contact, trading
- **Medical Officer**: Health, life support (large ships)
- **Quartermaster**: Cargo, supplies (large ships)

###  **3. Dual-Parameter Theme System**
- **Theme**: Character archetype/personality (e.g., "space pirate", "corporate executive")
- **Context**: Background story/circumstances (e.g., "owes debt to Space Mafia", "seeking revenge")

**Combined Example:**
```python
theme="grizzled military veteran"
context="retired after 30 years, now exploring galaxy peacefully"

Result: "Jump complete to {SystemName}. These old bones have seen enough combat - just here for the scenery, soldier."
```

###  **4. AI-Powered Generation via Claude Desktop**
Leverages existing Claude Desktop connection without requiring external AI services or additional authentication.

**No Additional Session Management Required:**
- Uses existing MCP  Claude Desktop connection
- No API keys, rate limiting, or external dependencies
- AI generation happens in Claude Desktop context

##  Technical Implementation

### **New MCP Tools**
```python
# Theme Management
set_edcopilot_theme(theme: str, context: str) -> Dict
set_crew_member_theme(crew_role: str, theme: str, context: str) -> Dict
configure_ship_crew(ship_name: str, crew_roles: List[str]) -> Dict

# Generation & Preview
generate_themed_templates_prompt(theme: str, context: str) -> Dict
apply_generated_templates(themed_templates: List[str]) -> Dict
preview_themed_content(crew_role: str = None) -> Dict

# Ship-Specific Management
auto_configure_crew_by_ship_class() -> Dict
set_ship_crew_themes(ship_name: str, crew_config: Dict) -> Dict

# Utility

### **File Organization**
```
EDCoPilot/User custom files/
 Ships/                              # Ship-specific crew configurations
    Anaconda/
       Navigator.Custom.txt
       Science.Custom.txt
       [other crew roles]
    AspExplorer/
    Sidewinder/
 Themes/                             # Theme backups and presets
    current_theme.json
    theme_history.json
    presets/
 EDCoPilot.SpaceChatter.Custom.txt   # Active ship's combined dialogue
 EDCoPilot.CrewChatter.Custom.txt    # Active ship's crew dialogue
```

##  User Experience Examples

### **Setting Up Themed Crew**
```
User: "Set up my Anaconda crew as a pirate crew. Make the navigator a by-the-book officer who reluctantly works for pirates, the science officer an excited treasure hunter, and the engineer a gruff old sea dog."

System Response:
[OK] Anaconda crew configured with pirate theme
[OK] Navigator: "Reluctant professional officer working for pirates"
[OK] Science Officer: "Excited treasure hunter and researcher"
[OK] Engineer: "Gruff old sea dog with decades of experience"
[OK] Generating themed dialogue for 6 crew members...
[OK] EDCoPilot files updated with pirate crew personalities

Result: Rich, diverse crew with individual personalities that interact naturally while maintaining pirate theme consistency.
```

### **Automatic Ship Switching**
```
Player switches from Anaconda to Sidewinder in Elite Dangerous

System automatically:
1. Detects ship change via journal monitoring
2. Switches from 6-person bridge crew to solo pilot dialogue
3. Applies appropriate personality for small ship operations
4. Updates EDCoPilot files seamlessly

Anaconda: "Navigation reports jump complete, Captain. All stations sound off."
Sidewinder: "Well, it's just you and me again, old girl. Let's see what this system has to offer."
```

### **Theme Evolution**
```
User: "My character has gone from pirate to legitimate trader. Update the themes to reflect this change while keeping the crew personalities."

System:
[OK] Updates theme from "space pirate" to "reformed pirate turned legitimate trader"
[OK] Preserves individual crew personalities but adjusts dialogue context
[OK] Generates new dialogue reflecting character growth and legal trading focus

Result: Seamless character development while maintaining established crew relationships.
```
