# Session Report: Headless EDCoPilot CLI Planning + Parser Fix Detour

Date: 2025-09-18
Branch: feature/headless-edcopilot-cli
PR: https://github.com/GWLlosa/elite-dangerous-local-ai-tie-in-mcp/pull/new/feature/headless-edcopilot-cli

## Summary

- Planned Milestone 16: Headless EDCoPilot Generation CLI (Direct mode) and added a brief summary + link in the project implementation plan.
- Added "Coming Soon" docs sections for the headless CLI in README and scripts/README.
- Scaffolded a new CLI test suite (planning-only, currently skipped) and updated the test runner to include it.
- Ran full tests and briefly detoured to fix JournalParser and DataStore test failures to keep baseline green.

## Work Completed

1) Milestone Plan
- Added: `docs/milestones/MILESTONE_16_HEADLESS_EDCOPILOT_CLI.md`
- Added summary and link in `ai-directives/project_implementation_plan.md`

2) Documentation
- README.md: Added "Headless EDCoPilot Generation (Coming Soon)" with usage and defaults.
- scripts/README.md: Added `generate_edcopilot.py` (Coming Soon) entry.

3) Tests
- Added: `tests/cli/test_generate_edcopilot_cli.py` (planning-only, marked skipped)
- Updated: `scripts/run_tests.py` to run CLI tests and include them in coverage run
- Updated: `pyproject.toml` will include a new `cli` marker (see Next Steps below if pending)

4) Parser Fixes (Detour)
- `src/journal/parser.py`:
  - Support legacy journal filename pattern `Journal.YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.NN.log[.backup]` in addition to ISO-like pattern
  - More robust `read_journal_file` when given `None`
- Result: JournalParser unit tests now pass.

5) DataStore Fixes (Detour)
- `src/utils/data_store.py`:
  - Accept legacy key_data fields: `system_name`, `station_name`, `body_name` alongside `system`, `station`, `body`
- Result: DataStore unit tests now pass.

## Test Results Snapshot

- Parser suite: PASS (33 tests)
- Monitor + Events suites: PASS (82 tests)
- DataStore suite: PASS (24 tests)
- Server suite: PASS (21 tests)
- MCP Tools suite: PASS (26 tests)
- CLI suite: currently ERR due to pytest marker configuration; tests are otherwise skipped by design (planning phase)

## Next Steps

Immediate
- Add `cli` marker to pytest config to satisfy `--strict-markers` (pyproject.toml).
- Re-run full test runner to show a clean baseline including the skipped CLI test suite.

Milestone 16 Implementation (following approval)
- Implement `scripts/generate_edcopilot.py` per the plan (defaults, flags, UTC handling, backups, grammar validation, ASCII-only).
- Add unit + integration tests (replace planning skips with real assertions).
- Update docs per tri-file protocol.
- Open PR for review; do not mark complete until all tests pass and approval is given.

## Notes

- All Markdown documentation across the repo was previously sanitized to ASCII-only and duplicate/conflicting status sections were consolidated.
- The test runner was updated to reference `src/elite_mcp` paths instead of `src/mcp`.
