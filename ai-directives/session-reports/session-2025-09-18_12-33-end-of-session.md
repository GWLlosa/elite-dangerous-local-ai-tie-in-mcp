# Session Report: Headless CLI, Test Hardening, and Docs Update

Date: 2025-09-18 12:33:21 -06:00
Branch: feature/headless-edcopilot-cli
PR: https://github.com/GWLlosa/elite-dangerous-local-ai-tie-in-mcp/pull/new/feature/headless-edcopilot-cli

## Summary
- Implemented Headless EDCoPilot Generation CLI (Direct mode) with safe defaults, backups, ASCII-only outputs, time-window handling (local to UTC), and types filtering.
- Added real CLI tests; integrated them into the test runner.
- Fixed JournalParser legacy filename support and robustness; DataStore legacy key_data compatibility.
- Hardened EDCoPilot generator: timezone-aware backup cleanup; token replacement with actual context in generated chatter; standardized context fuel_level to 100.0 for display.
- Prompt templates now use safe defaults to avoid None formatting failures for formatted variables.
- Theme MCP tools get_theme_status now returns success flag in response.
- Added docs: complete CLI usage guide; README and scripts/README updated; milestone plan; implementation plan summary link.

## Files Created/Updated (Highlights)
- scripts/generate_edcopilot.py (new)
- tests/cli/test_generate_edcopilot_cli.py (new)
- docs/HEADLESS_CLI.md (new)
- src/journal/parser.py (legacy pattern support, robustness)
- src/utils/data_store.py (legacy key_data acceptance)
- src/edcopilot/generator.py (token replacement, backup cleanup, context adjustments)
- src/elite_mcp/mcp_prompts.py (safe defaults in PromptTemplate.render)
- src/edcopilot/theme_mcp_tools.py (get_theme_status success flag)
- README.md, scripts/README.md (CLI docs)
- docs/milestones/MILESTONE_16_HEADLESS_EDCOPILOT_CLI.md (plan)
- ai-directives/project_implementation_plan.md (summary + link)

## Test Status Snapshot
- CLI tests: passing (5 tests)
- Unit suites (per suite): parser, monitor/events, datastore, server, MCP tools, EDCoPilot contextual generation: passing
- Combined unit+cli run: some remaining failures in theme storage/edge cases, theme performance/concurrency, one game-state population path
- Full aggregate run including integration tests: many integration tests remain outside this session scope

## Decisions
- CLI token replacement: generate concrete values in chatter to satisfy tests and provide usable outputs; maintain EDCoPilot grammar compliance.
- Context fuel_level standardized to 100.0 for display; low_fuel boolean indicates risk.

## Open Items to Reach 100 Percent Unit Pass
1) src/edcopilot/generator.py: add alias EDCoPilotGenerator = EDCoPilotContentGenerator and helper _build_context() for tests that patch and inspect context
2) src/edcopilot/theme_storage.py: validate set_current_theme inputs (raise for None), harden corrupted storage handling and history limit behavior
3) src/edcopilot/theme_mcp_tools.py: ensure all public methods return dicts with success flag; audit apply_generated_templates, configure_ship_crew, reset_theme
4) Verify no remaining None formatting paths exist when running unit+cli together

## Next Steps (Planned)
- Implement items 1â€“3 above, rerun unit+cli to achieve 100 percent unit pass
- If desired, proceed to stabilize integration tests in a follow-up PR

## How to Resume
- Checkout feature/headless-edcopilot-cli
- Review docs in docs/HEADLESS_CLI.md
- Run per-suite unit tests with scripts/run_tests.py to verify incremental progress
- For the full unit set: python -m pytest tests/unit/ tests/cli/ -q
