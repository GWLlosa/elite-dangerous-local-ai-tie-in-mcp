2. **NAVIGATION** - Jump, dock, undock, location changes
3. **EXPLORATION** - Scan, discovery, mapping
4. **COMBAT** - Combat-related events
5. **TRADING** - Buy, sell, market interactions
6. **MISSION** - Mission accept, complete, fail
7. **ENGINEERING** - Engineering and modifications
8. **MINING** - Mining and refinery operations
9. **PASSENGER** - Passenger missions and cabin events
10. **SQUADRON** - Squadron and wing events
11. **POWERPLAY** - Powerplay activities
12. **CREW** - Multi-crew and NPC crew events
13. **SOCIAL** - Friends, communication
14. **SHIP** - Ship purchase, modification, transfer
15. **SUIT** - Odyssey on-foot activities
16. **CARRIER** - Fleet carrier operations
17. **OTHER** - Uncategorized events

### Key Features Implemented
- **Event Validation**: Validates required fields and timestamp formats
- **Key Data Extraction**: Extracts relevant data based on event type
- **Summary Generation**: Creates human-readable descriptions
- **Statistics Generation**: Provides comprehensive event analytics
- **Unknown Event Tracking**: Maintains list of unrecognized events
- **Performance Optimized**: Processes 1000+ events in <2 seconds

## Next Steps for Future Sessions

### Immediate Actions
1. **Merge PR #2** to main branch after review
2. **Begin Milestone 6**: Data storage and retrieval
3. **Design data store architecture** for event persistence

### Milestone 6 Planning
- In-memory event storage with size management
- Current state tracking (location, ship, status)
- Time-based event filtering and cleanup
- Efficient event querying and aggregation

### Testing Standards Maintained
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: 97% code coverage achieved
- **Integration Testing**: Full pipeline validated
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Met all requirements
- **Documentation**: Fully updated

## Knowledge Preservation Notes

### Critical Insights for Future AI Assistants
- **Event Processing Architecture**: Centralized processor with category mapping works well
- **Test Coverage Strategy**: Combination of unit and integration tests ensures reliability
- **Performance Considerations**: 1000 events/2 seconds benchmark validates real-time capability
- **Integration Pattern**: Loose coupling with parser/monitor allows flexible usage

### Patterns That Worked Well
- **Dataclass for ProcessedEvent**: Clean structure for event data
- **Enum for Categories**: Type-safe category management
- **Dictionary Mapping**: Efficient event type to category lookup
- **Modular Functions**: Separate functions for categorize/summarize/statistics

### Technical Patterns Established
- **Event Processing Pipeline**: Parse -> Process -> Categorize -> Summarize
- **Error Handling**: Validation errors collected but processing continues
- **Unknown Event Tracking**: Set-based tracking prevents duplicates
- **Timezone Handling**: Proper ISO timestamp parsing with timezone support
