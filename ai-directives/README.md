**Project Goal**: Create an MCP server that connects Elite Dangerous journal data to Claude Desktop, enabling real-time game state queries and AI assistance.

**Before Starting Any Work**:
1. Review this document completely
2. Check recent session reports in `ai-directives/session-reports/`
3. Verify current milestone status below
4. Run `python scripts/check_environment.py` to validate setup
5. **MANDATORY**: Monitor conversation limits and execute session protocol when needed

## üîÑ Development Workflow Standard

### Pull Request Workflow (MANDATORY)
**This is the standard workflow for all development going forward:**

1. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/milestone-name
   ```

2. **Implement Changes**
   - Write code following all quality standards
   - Create/update tests alongside implementation
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Create Pull Request**
   - Push branch to GitHub
   - Create PR with comprehensive description
   - List all changes and features implemented

4. **Test Verification Phase**
   - Run tests on the feature branch
   - Share test results with user
   - **WAIT FOR USER CONFIRMATION** - Do not merge until user confirms tests pass
   - Fix any issues identified

5. **Merge Only After Approval**
   - User must explicitly state "tests pass" or "merge approved"
   - Only then merge PR to main
   - Document completion in milestone status file

### Example Workflow Communication
```
AI: "I've created PR #X for Milestone Y. The tests are showing [results]. 
     Please review and let me know when tests pass so I can merge."
User: "Tests pass, you can merge."
AI: "Merging PR #X now..."
```

## üîß Development Standards

### Code Quality Requirements
- **PEP 8 compliance** with type hints
- **Comprehensive documentation** with docstrings
- **Test coverage >90%** for new code
- **Real tests, not stubs** - proper assertions required
- **Error handling** with graceful failure
- **Cross-platform compatibility** (Windows, Linux, macOS)

### Character Encoding Rules
**CRITICAL**: Use ASCII-only characters in all output and scripts

#### ‚úÖ ALLOWED
- ASCII printable characters (32-126)
- Status indicators: `[SUCCESS]`, `[FAILED]`, `[ERROR]`, `[WARNING]`, `[INFO]`
- ASCII box drawing: `=`, `-`, `|`, `+`

#### ‚ùå FORBIDDEN  
- Unicode emojis (cause Windows cp1252 errors)
- Extended Unicode symbols
- Smart quotes
- Mathematical symbols (use ASCII: <=, >=, +/-, etc.)

### Datetime Timezone Consistency
**CRITICAL**: All datetime objects must be timezone-aware using UTC

```python
# ‚ùå WRONG - Creates timezone-naive datetime
timestamp = datetime.utcnow()

# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Creates timezone-aware datetime
from datetime import datetime, timezone
timestamp = datetime.now(timezone.utc)
```

### ProcessedEvent Data Structure
**IMPORTANT**: ProcessedEvent uses `raw_event` parameter, not `data`

```python
# ‚ùå WRONG
ProcessedEvent(data={"key": "value"})
event.data.get("key")  # Use raw_event instead

# ‚úÖ CORRECT
ProcessedEvent(raw_event={"key": "value"})
event.raw_event.get("key")  # Access data through raw_event
```

### FastMCP Framework Rules
**CRITICAL**: FastMCP limitations and patterns

```python
# ‚ùå WRONG - FastMCP decorators that don't exist
@app.resource()  # Does not exist
@app.prompt()    # Does not exist

# ‚ùå WRONG - FastMCP attribute that doesn't exist
server.app.tools.keys()  # 'tools' attribute doesn't exist

# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Only tool decorator is supported
@app.tool()  # All handlers use tool decorator

# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Access patterns
# FastMCP doesn't expose tools collection directly
# Handlers are configured but not accessible via attributes
```

### DataStore Method Names
**IMPORTANT**: Use correct method names for data access

```python
# ‚ùå WRONG - Method doesn't exist
data_store.get_all_events()

# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Use existing methods
data_store.get_recent_events(minutes=60)
data_store.get_events_by_type("FSDJump")
data_store.get_events_by_category(EventCategory.EXPLORATION)
```

## üîÑ Session Management Protocol

### Conversation Limit Monitoring

**After EVERY response, assess if**:
- Estimated remaining interactions ‚â§ 5-6 responses
- More than 2 major tasks completed in session
- Conversation has >30 total interactions
- Any milestone implementation completed
- PR created and awaiting test verification

**If ANY threshold reached**: 
1. Announce: "Conversation capacity threshold reached. Executing mandatory knowledge preservation protocol."
2. Create session report in `ai-directives/session-reports/`
3. Update ai-directives with new discoveries
4. Commit all changes to Git
5. Note any pending PRs awaiting test results
6. Offer to continue in fresh session

### Session Report Template
```markdown
# AI Session Report - [DATE TIME]

## Session Summary
- Duration, Focus, Status
- PRs created and their status

## New Rules Discovered
- Technical Corrections
- Process Improvements  
- Project Facts

## Work Completed
- Tasks, Commits, Milestones
- Test results and issues found

## Pending Items
- PRs awaiting test verification
- Issues to be fixed

## Next Steps
- Recommendations for future sessions

## Knowledge Preservation Notes
- Critical insights
- Successful patterns
- Things to avoid
```

## üìö Technical Rules & Patterns

### Package Import Mapping
- `python-dateutil` imports as `dateutil`, not `python_dateutil`
- FastMCP server uses singleton pattern with proper lifecycle management
- Background tasks require proper async/await patterns

### Error Handling Requirements
- Scripts must report accurate failure status and exit codes
- Real verification vs. placeholder success reporting
- Detailed error messages with troubleshooting steps

### Testing Standards
- Use same datetime patterns in tests as production
- Mock data must match production data structures
- Integration tests verify cross-component functionality
- Always run tests before merging PRs

### MCP Server Specifics
- Server starts journal monitoring automatically on startup
- Background tasks managed with asyncio
- Signal handling for graceful shutdown
- All handlers use @app.tool() decorator (no resource/prompt decorators)
- Resources and prompts accessed via tool functions
