# AI Directives

This directory contains comprehensive project guidance and implementation directives for AI assistants working on the Elite Dangerous Local AI Tie-In MCP project.

## ðŸ“‹ Purpose

This directory serves as a central repository for:
- **Project implementation plans** with detailed milestone breakdowns
- **Development standards** and quality requirements
- **Testing procedures** and validation criteria
- **Architecture decisions** and design principles
- **AI collaboration guidelines** for consistent development

## ðŸ“š Available Documents

### [`project_implementation_plan.md`](project_implementation_plan.md)
**Comprehensive 15-milestone implementation roadmap**

**Features:**
- âœ… **Enhanced milestone structure** with test review at each stage
- âœ… **Detailed implementation tasks** for each milestone
- âœ… **Testing criteria** and validation requirements
- âœ… **Test review procedures** to maintain quality
- âœ… **GitHub workflow guidelines** with commit standards
- âœ… **Current progress tracking** (Milestones 1-4 completed)

**Usage:**
- Reference for milestone planning and execution
- Guide for test quality standards and procedures
- Framework for maintaining development consistency
- Validation criteria for milestone completion

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Principles

### Test-Driven Development
Every milestone includes:
- **Comprehensive unit tests** with >90% coverage requirement
- **Test review and documentation** phase
- **Automation script integration** for reliability
- **Performance validation** and benchmarking
- **Integration testing** for end-to-end functionality

### Quality Standards
- **Code quality**: PEP 8, type hints, documentation
- **Test quality**: Real tests, not stubs, with proper assertions
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides with examples
- **Automation**: Scripts for setup, testing, and validation
- **Error handling**: Graceful failure and recovery procedures

### Development Workflow
1. **Implementation** following milestone tasks
2. **Unit testing** with comprehensive coverage
3. **Test review** to validate quality and completeness
4. **Documentation update** including automation scripts
5. **Integration validation** with existing components
6. **Performance verification** meeting requirements

## ðŸš€ For AI Assistants

When working on this project:

### Before Starting a Milestone:
1. **Review the implementation plan** for the specific milestone
2. **Understand testing requirements** and quality standards
3. **Check current project status** and completed milestones
4. **Validate environment** using automation scripts

### During Development:
1. **Follow implementation tasks** as outlined in the plan
2. **Write comprehensive tests** alongside code implementation
3. **Use automation scripts** for validation and testing
4. **Maintain code quality** standards throughout

### At Milestone Completion:
1. **Execute test review procedure** as defined in the plan
2. **Validate all testing criteria** are met
3. **Update documentation** and automation scripts
4. **Verify integration** with existing components
5. **Update project status** and milestone tracking

### Quality Checkpoints:
- âœ… **All tests pass** with required coverage
- âœ… **Tests are comprehensive**, not stubs or placeholders
- âœ… **Documentation is updated** with new functionality
- âœ… **Automation scripts work** with new components
- âœ… **Performance meets requirements** for real-time operation

## ðŸ“Š Current Project Status

**Completed Milestones:** 1-4 âœ…
- Project structure and configuration âœ…
- Journal parsing and real-time monitoring âœ…
- Comprehensive test infrastructure âœ…
- Automation scripts and documentation âœ…

**Test Infrastructure:**
- 47+ unit tests with >96% coverage
- Automation scripts for setup/check/test
- Comprehensive testing documentation
- Mock data for reliable testing

**Next Milestone:** 5 - Event Processing and Classification

## ðŸ”„ Continuous Improvement

This directory and its contents should be:
- **Updated regularly** as the project evolves
- **Enhanced with lessons learned** from each milestone
- **Maintained as the source of truth** for project direction
- **Used to ensure consistency** across development sessions

The goal is to maintain high-quality development standards while ensuring efficient progress through the implementation milestones.

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics

Each milestone completion should demonstrate:
- âœ… **Functional implementation** meeting all requirements
- âœ… **Comprehensive testing** with excellent coverage
- âœ… **Updated documentation** reflecting new functionality
- âœ… **Working automation** validating the implementation
- âœ… **Integration success** with existing components
- âœ… **Performance compliance** for real-time operation

This ensures the project maintains quality and reliability throughout the development process while building toward the ultimate goal of seamless Elite Dangerous and Claude Desktop integration.
